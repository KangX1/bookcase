#--- About ---
#
#The script expands macros defined in a .cpp or .C file and outputs the result
#into a new file within a created expandedMacroCode directory.
#
#To expand OpenFOAM macros, the script must be called from a directory
#containing the Make directory, otherwise it cannot find the include
#directories for macro definition.
#
#
#The C++ styling program "astyle" is used to format the output code. The
#generated code is ready for the compiler, but not for human eyes. Use search
#facilities of your favourite (Vim :) editor to find the scope / expression you
#are interested in.
#
#
#Requirements: gcc, astyle
